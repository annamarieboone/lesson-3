        <h1>Is this making sense?</h1>

        <h4>1. Some boxes in a row.</h4>
          <p id="noline">Here’s a bunch of boxes floated next to each other with numbers in the middle, but two of them are special.
            <div id="grey">B</div>
            <div id="orange">L</div>
            <div id="grey">O</div>
            <div id="grey">C</div>
            <div id="orange">K</div>

        <h4>2. This is a photo of a cat.</h4> 
          <p>Drop an image of a cat here that fills the width of this column. You’ll probably have to use something like <span>width: 100%;</span>. And for that little guy, you’ll have to use something like <span>font-family: monospace; </span>.
            <img src="images/flyingcat.jpg"/>
          </p>
        <h4>3. This is a big link.</h4>
          <p>When you hover over it, it changes color. When you click it, it opens up Google in another tab. You don’t need to use a <span>div</span> for this. An a tag is an inline element, but you can make it a block element with css.
